AssessCIRCC is an application designed for Assessing Change in Intervention Research, emphasizing the Benefits of Composite Outcomes. In intervention research, where resources and time are substantial, AssessCIRCC proposes the use of composite scores by combining multiple outcome measures into a unified assessment. This approach, as advocated in the paper, offers a more effective evaluation of intervention effectiveness. The application provides tools to simulate intervention studies, allowing users to compare scenarios where measures are treated separately, one is designated as the primary outcome, or all are combined into a composite outcome. By conducting a one-tailed t-test in a simulated intervention group, users can explore the impact of different factors such as the number of participants, measures, effect size, and correlations between measures.
